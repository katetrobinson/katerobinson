                <p>Foundational research consisted of conducting user interviews and competitive audits to test early concepts, better understand what problems actually exist in the space, and thereby create a useful value proposition.</p>

                        <p>Based on competitive audits, it became clear that audience and easy branding is key when the brand is reaching their audience of pets and people. Our audience is busy and urban, aspects like accessibility, modern style, and quick usability were primary needs.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>User interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of users to ultimately form empathy maps and affinity diagrams, which then allowed the team to deduce user pain points. Eclectic personas with overarching user stories and journey maps were created, cultivating a higher understanding of and empathize towards primary users of the app and clients affected by the app.</p>
            <p class="allof"><br>All of the above, in combination with four competitive audits, determine the optimal value propositions to differentiate our veterinarian responsive online website. <br> <br> </p>

            <h2><br> Sitemap</h2>
            <p>To make the app as efficient as possible before starting the design, a quick sitemap was thoughtfully constructed to best lay out all the essential needs of a veterinary clinic and their clients. <br> </p>

                <p>From busy professionals with big furry families to hard-working college students with fluffy friends, all desire an efficient online portal for quick scheduling and registration for their pets.

            <p><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Paper wireframes</span> were drafted first through crazy eights and how might we methodologies, paired with additional brainstorming and storyboarding before becoming digitized. </p>
            <p>Based on user goals and competitive audits, data-driven and holistic insights and tools as well as on-the-go features and accessible tools were included in the <span style="font-weight: bolder;">digital wireframes</span>, which were created to hone in on the visual structure.</p>

                <p>To transform from wireframe to lo-fi then hi-fi mockups, multiple usability studies were conducted once the initial designs were strategized and fully formed.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Usability studies</span> were conducted after all wireframes and interactions were drafted, then after lo-fi mockups were created to create the final hi-fi design.</p>
                <p><br> Through studies, it was found that the light and fun branding of the design. However, it was also found that features such as more connectivity between pages, logos, and images were needed as well as a cleaner form and calendar setup. Users would also like a secure way to make payments online.</p>
