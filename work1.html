                        <p>As a part of the Google UX Design Certificate, the goal of this project was to create a holistic, data-driven, accessible, on-the-go, and fun-forward practice management app for mental health professionals.</p>
                        <p><br> There are so many aspects of a therapy practice that can be challenging to manage all at once, all the time. On top of client management, mental health professionals need to track items included in billing and scheduling to ensure their schedule and payments are in ship-shape.</p>

                <p>Foundational research consisted of conducting user interviews and competitive audits to test early concepts, better understand what problems actually exist in the space, and thereby create a useful value proposition.</p>

                        <p>Therapists, mental health professionals, and clinicians struggle to manage clients, practices, billing, forms, and tasks, on top of their personal lives.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column4">
                        <h2>Industry Standards</h2>
                        <p>Based on competitive audits, it became clear that many practice management applications lack everything needed to manage a practice, assistive tech for those with disabilities, and/or mobile apps as a service.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>User interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of users to ultimately form empathy maps and affinity diagrams, which then allowed the team to deduce user pain points. Eclectic personas with overarching user stories and journey maps were created, cultivating a higher understanding of and empathize towards primary users of the app and clients affected by the app.</p>
            <p><br>All of the above, in combination with four competitive audits, determine the optimal value propositions to differentiate our holistic therapy app.</p>

            <h2>Pain Points</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #56876D;">Time.</span> Therapists are too busy to spend time with several overly complex apps.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #56876D;">Accessibility.</span> Platforms for client billing are not equipped with enough assistive technologies, particularly regarding the client portal.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #56876D;">Information Architecture.</span> Itâ€™s challenging for therapists to track insurance claims, therapy sessions, and billing all in one condensed location.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #56876D;">Navigation between multiple apps.</span> Disconnected, non-integrated apps and sites increase frustration and time away from patients. </li>

                <p>The design process followed an iterative and lean approach.</p>
                <h2>Key strategy & focus areas</h2>
                <p>The differentiating strategy was to position the product as the leading practice management app for therapists, clinicians, and other mental health professionals, by way of efficient and simplified:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. Task oversight</li>
                    <li>2. Calendar organization</li>
                    <li>3. Billing administration</li>

            <h2>Wireframing</h2>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Paper wireframes</span> were rapidly prototyped first through crazy eights and how might we methodologies, paired with additional brainstorming and storyboarding before becoming digitized. </p>
            <img src="Media/Paper Wireframes (Therapist App).png" alt="Paper wireframes">
            <p>Based on user goals and competitive audits, data-driven and holistic tools as well as on-the-go features and accessible tools were included in the <span style="font-weight: bolder;">digital wireframes</span>, which were created to hone in on the visual structure.</p>

                <h2 class="refinedesign4">04/ Refining the design</h2>
                <p>Post-wireframing, multiple usability studies were conducted to transform the design <span style="font-weight: bolder;">from wireframes to low-fidelity then high-fidelity mockups</span>.</p>
                <h2>Usability studies</h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Usability studies</span> were conducted before lo-fi mockups were drafted and after lo-fi mockups were drafted to create the final hi-fi design.</p>
                <p> <br> Through studies, it was discovered that additional accessibility considerations could be instilled in the app, billing and client contact pages are increasingly important for mental health professionals, and specific pages could be redesigned to allow for optimal navigation and connectivity.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
            <p>The following considerations were integrated along the way and into the final designs: specific tools section which holds all features which connect to assistive-tech, specifically screen readers and additional text magnification; text considerations such as color modification and dark mode options for contrast changes and color blind friendly options; compatibility with various language options.</p>
